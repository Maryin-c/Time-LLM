Analyze hourly traffic data from the California Department of Transportation, collected via sensors on San Francisco Bay Area freeways, to identify trends, forecast occupancy rates, and detect anomalies. The dataset includes timestamps, sensor IDs, locations, and occupancy rates, allowing for time series forecasting using models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTMs. Detect seasonal patterns, peak traffic hours, and unusual congestion due to accidents or road conditions. Provide actionable insights, including predicted occupancy rates, anomaly reports, and recommendations for traffic optimization. Ensure results are interpretable, structured, and relevant for urban planning and congestion management.
